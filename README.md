# spacefillerlib

**spacefillerlib** is a collection of classes used in the implementation of interactive installation art by
[SPACEFILLER](http://spacefiller.space). The two standout features of this library are the `mapping` package,
which supports sophisticated, interactive projection mapping, and the `particles` package, which offers an
optimized CPU particle simulator.

This library is under heavy construction and does not contain any documentation, and documentation is not currently
being written. Use at your own risk.
